Software: Programs in RAM
Firmware: Operating system burned into ROM
Hardware: The physical components of the machine

The reset switch or a power cycle are both capable of booting the monitor program, which in turns runs the bootstrap and starts CP/M.

CP/M handles many I/O port protocol allowing for standardization across machines that was not before possible due to a lack of standard protocol for I/O ports. CP/M also handles disk addressing, allowing the programmer to ignore these low level details and complete portability.

The firmware and CP/M operating systems takes about 6 KB of RAM from the top of the memory and the buffers take 256 bytes from the first address leaving the rest for user programs. Our simulator has the full 64 KB of RAM available, but the book will assume that we have the minimum of 16 KB of RAM or around 10 KB of free RAM for our programs.
